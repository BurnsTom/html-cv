    <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Seasoned in steering transformative product strategies, I am a Senior Product Manager and newly appointed Chapter Lead of Product and Design at WooliesX. Over my 2-year tenure, I've ascended from a Product Manager to a Senior Product Manager, now entrusted to lead a dedicated Marketplace Chapter. My journey has been marked by diverse initiatives, shaping end-to-end customer experiences and delving into seller and platform innovations.
            </p>
            <p>My recent focus revolves around spearheading a pioneering squad within Woolworths Market Plus, creating a marketplace middleware platform. This endeavor aims to bolster capabilities & enable trade for several marketplaces within the Woolworths umbrella. Prior to this, my extensive 6-year tenure at eBay Australia encompassed multifaceted roles across product, marketing, operations, and merchandising.
            </p>
            <p>Eager to continue driving impactful strategies and fostering innovation, I bring a wealth of experience in product evolution, market expansion, and cross-functional leadership.
